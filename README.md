plot_tally(....)
```
Input validation is only applied in this front-end function. Other functions are hidden by default.
If you want to expose it, ***DO AT YOUR OWN RISK***.

## Documentation
This documentation is only available to front-end functions. Other functions used by those functions are strictly internal and optimised.

### ```data_miner.plot_tally```
Draw the COVID-19 statistics plots of different countries in a period of time, using different scales and types.\
_Return value_: Returns 0 if no errors occured and -1 if at least one error occurs.\
##### _Positional arguments_:
* _country_: A string or a list of string. Each string is a name of a country you want to plot.
* _date_: A string of date in this format ```dd-mm-yyyy```. This is the date of the latest data to be plotted.
* _timespan_: An integer. This is the period of data to be plotted, from the _date_ backwards.
##### _Keyword arguments_:
* _scale_: A string or a list of string. Each string is either "log" or "linear, indicating the type of y-scale of the country to be plotted. Default is "log".
* _plot_type_: A string or a list of string. Each string consists of letter (c)onfirmed cases, (d)eaths, (r)ecovered cases and (a)ctive cases, indicating the type of plot to be drawn.
